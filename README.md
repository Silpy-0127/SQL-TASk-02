# SQL Internship - TASK 02: Data Insertion, NULL Handling, Update, Delete & Final View  
## üíº Local Market E-Commerce Database ‚Äì PostgreSQL
---

## üìå Overview

This project simulates a backend database system for a local market e-commerce platform using **PostgreSQL**. It covers full **Data Definition** and **Data Manipulation** operations including:

- Data Reset  
- Bulk Insertion (10 records in each table)  
- Targeted Updates (handling `NULL`s and meaningful updates)  
- Conditional Deletions  
- Final verification through `SELECT` queries  

The schema is designed for a small seller ecosystem including sellers, products, customers, inventory, and transaction management.

---

## üß± Tables Involved

- `Sellers`  
- `Customers`  
- `Categories`  
- `Products`  
- `Inventory`  
- `Orders`  
- `OrderItems`  
- `Payments`

---

## üîÅ Operations Performed

### ‚úÖ 1. TRUNCATE  
All tables are reset using:
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE ... RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

---

### ‚úÖ 2. INSERT (10 Records Each)

Data is inserted into each table with variations including:

- `NULL` values for update demonstration  
- Diverse categories, products, and payment methods

---

### ‚úÖ 3. UPDATE (Multiple Tables)

Handled:

- `NULL` correction for email/phone fields  
- Price and description updates  
- Stock restock and quantity changes  
- Order status and date corrections  
- Payment method and amount changes

---

### ‚úÖ 4. DELETE (Conditional)

Deleted:

- Customers with phone numbers starting with `'90'`  
- Sellers in specific test cities  
- Orders with status `'Cancelled'` or `'Pending'`  
- Inventory items with low stock  
- Products above a price threshold or containing keywords like `'Pen'`  
- Unneeded categories such as `'Stationery'`, `'Footwear'`

---

### ‚úÖ 5. SELECT

Used `SELECT * FROM` queries at the end to confirm the final data state of all tables.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL**  
- **pgAdmin 4**

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open **pgAdmin**  
2. Create or connect to a database (e.g., `LocalMarketDB`)  
3. Open the **Query Tool**  
4. Paste and run the provided SQL script  
5. Verify your output using the final `SELECT` statements

---

## üìù Notes

- `RESTART IDENTITY` resets all auto-incrementing primary key IDs  
- `CASCADE` ensures foreign key‚Äìlinked deletions work correctly  
- Designed as an academic/internship project to practice:
  - `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`  
  - `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `IS NULL`, `CASCADE`
